## 2. **Architecture**
### Architectural Style
- Monolithic architecture (MVP phase)
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Backend: Python/FastAPI

### System Components
1. **File Processing Engine**
   - Handle file upload
   - Check Google page for supported file types: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/document-processing
   - Google Gemini API for document analysis
   - TXT file support for users to copy-paste chunk of text
   - Future improvements:
     - Support more file types
     - Support screenshot to calendar
2. **Calendar Authentication**
   - Support Google Sign-In for Google Calendar API
   - In the future, support other calendar services like Apple Calendar, Microsoft Calendar, etc.
3. **Calendar Export**
   - Google Calendar API integration
   - If user signed in, add events to user's calendar directly
   - Support .ics file export
4. **User Interface**
   - File upload portal
   - User input box for text
   - Event confirmation/editing interface
   - OAuth2 authentication flow
5. **Database**
   - Not necessary for MVP
   - In the future, support user history, Canvas integration, etc.
### Data Flow

    A[User Upload] --> B(Gemini API)
    B --> C{User logged in?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Event Confirmation UI]
    C -->|No| E[Suggest user sign in and export .ics file]
    D --> F[Google Calendar API]
